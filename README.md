# Tutorials on Tinygrad

A series of tutorials that help you understand the internals of tinygrad
and be better equipped if you want to contribute to it.

I suggest you read them in the following order:

1. [high level overview using dot product as example](dotproduct.md)

2. [how kernel fusion starts](scheduleitem.md)

3. [explaining the tinygrad IR](uops.md)

4. [tinygrad backend](backends.md)

5. [shapetracker](shapetracker.md) and [dimension merging](mergedim.md)
