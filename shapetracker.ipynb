    "Shapetracker enables zero-cost movement operations. What that means is you need a way to represent linearly laid out data on the memory strip as a multi dimensional structure, and also that if you have to reshape a huge tensor, the underlying data that's in the memory doesn't have to changed, it's only the information on how to access those data changes. Let me explain with a concrete example, if you have 8 numbers `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and throughout your program, you need to present them to the user in various ways, maybe one after another: 1. as a 8 digits laid out linearly. 2. as a 4 by 2 matrix. 3. as a 2 X 2 X 2 cube. So the output would be like this\n",

    "You can't store such cubic structure in memory directly, they will be laid out flat linearly, so you need to come up with a way to access it as if they are a cube or a grid. Also, if your data is large, changing the underlying storage on memory may be expensive, but it turns out the data can remain unchanged (always as [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]), we have to just keep a record of how to access them when the data need to be presented (keeping such a record does come with overhead, so it only make sense when your data is large, like thousands of numbers stored in memory).\n",
