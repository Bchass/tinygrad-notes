    "We now have an autograd engine that can run on both CPU and GPU, if you throw in more implementation for other common operations, you can start running some multilayer perceptron already. There is a big limitation though, in part 3, the shape is assumed to be (1,). In tinygrad, this is handled with a shape tracker, let's see how it works and how to implement it. \n",
